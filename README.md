## Feature branch workflow
A branch should be created for each new feature, and then merged into the master branch once the feature is tested. This workflow is only adapted to closed teams sharing a similar experience in terms of coding, where each developer has at least a basic understanding of how git works.

###### The adopted naming practice for this project's branches is the following : token/short-name

```Example of token : feature, doc```

###### Commit naming convention

```Example of name : tags, users```
